mostly breaking transformer models to see what happens

& (experimenting with architectures, scaling, and other bad ideas)  

& documenting what happens when you argue with transformers (and transformers fight back)

& (and my mistakes in HD) (and the occasional existential crisis)  

& graphs, glitches & occasional proofs that chaos has patterns

mostly breaking transformer models to see what happens

(experimenting with architectures, scaling, and other bad ideas)  

documenting what happens when you argue with transformers (and transformers fight back)

(and my mistakes in HD) (and the occasional existential crisis)  

(expect bugs, benchmarks, and opinions)  

now itâ€™s a rabbit hole
